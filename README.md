## Overview

Hand Draw is an innovative augmented reality (AR) application developed using Unity 3D, designed to revolutionize the way we interact with virtual environments. By leveraging advanced hand tracking technology, users can create 3D models in real-time by simply pinching and manipulating an expanding material in the air. This immersive experience is powered by a custom implementation of the Marching Cubes Algorithm, allowing for smooth and responsive model shaping.

## Features

- **Real-Time 3D Modeling:** Create and manipulate 3D shapes in real-time using hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Custom Marching Cubes Implementation:** Experience seamless and detailed modeling via an optimized Marching Cubes implementation.
- **Unity 3D Integration:** Built on the powerful Unity 3D platform, ensuring a high-quality AR experience.
- **Meta Oculus All-In-One hand tracking integration

## How It Works

Hand Draw uses the Meta XR All-in-One SDK to track the user's hand movements, translating pinches and movements into actions that manipulate the virtual material. This material expands and shapes into 3D models based on the user's gestures, offering an intuitive and natural way to create and interact with virtual objects.
